/**
 * React Query Client Provider Configuration
 *
 * Wraps the app with React Query (TanStack Query) for API call caching and state management.
 *
 * Configuration Strategy:
 * - staleTime: 5 minutes - Data considered fresh (no automatic refetch)
 * - gcTime: 10 minutes - Cache cleanup time for unused data (formerly cacheTime)
 * - retry: 1 - Single retry on failure (default is 3, reduced for faster feedback)
 * - refetchOnWindowFocus: false - Don't refetch when user returns to tab (manual refresh preferred)
 *
 * Why useState instead of useMemo?
 * React Query documentation recommends useState to ensure queryClient is created
 * only once and never recreated on re-renders. useMemo can theoretically recreate
 * the instance (React doesn't guarantee memoization), which would clear the cache
 * and cause unnecessary API calls.
 *
 * Devtools:
 * Enabled in all environments with initialIsOpen={false}.
 * Useful for debugging cache state and query behavior in development.
