## Description

Net Worth Tracker is a full-featured personal finance application built for Italian investors. It provides comprehensive portfolio tracking, performance analytics, cashflow management, dividend monitoring, and long-term financial planning tools — all in a single dashboard.

The app integrates with Yahoo Finance for real-time price updates and includes advanced features like Monte Carlo simulations, FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) projections, AI-powered performance analysis, and a dedicated AI assistant foundation via Claude. The UI is in Italian while the codebase follows English conventions.

## Key Features

### Portfolio Management
- Multi-asset tracking across stocks, ETFs, bonds, crypto, real estate, commodities, and cash — added via a guided two-step dialog: pick the asset type first, then fill in only the relevant fields for that type
- Multi-currency support: assets priced in USD, GBP, CHF, etc. are automatically converted to EUR for all portfolio calculations using live Frankfurter exchange rates; LSE pence (GBp) normalized to GBP automatically
- Automatic price updates via Yahoo Finance (all assets) and Borsa Italiana (Italian bonds with ISIN)
- Bond coupon scheduling: automatic coupon generation with step-up rate tiers and final premium (Premio Finale) support — full BTP Valore compatible
- Average cost tracking with 4-decimal precision, including a built-in multi-broker PMC calculator for positions spread across multiple brokers
- Current vs target asset allocation visualization
- Hierarchical asset allocation analysis with desktop drill-down and mobile bottom-sheet navigation
- **Portfolio exposure breakdown**: a collapsible section at the bottom of the Allocation page that aggregates underlying-company, sector, and ETF-issuer exposure across all your ETFs plus direct stocks. See your true exposure to a single company (e.g. Nvidia) when it's split across multiple ETFs, with click-to-expand calculation drill-down showing the formula per source ("X% di €Y = €Z") and a total per row. Data sourced server-side from Yahoo Finance and cached per user; the "Aggiorna" button forces a fresh server-side computation when needed
- Current-year historical tables use a hidden previous-month baseline so January can show growth vs the previous December without rendering an extra visible column

### Performance Analytics
- Comprehensive metrics: ROI, CAGR, TWR, IRR, Sharpe Ratio, Maximum Drawdown
- Yield on Cost (YOC) and Current Yield calculations
- Monthly returns heatmap and underwater drawdown chart
- Rolling performance charts
- **Benchmark comparison**: compare your portfolio against six model portfolios (60/40, All Weather, Buffett 90/10, Golden Butterfly, Permanent Portfolio, 100% ACWI) with an indexed growth-of-100 chart and a comprehensive risk/return table — TWR, Volatility, Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar, Max Drawdown, best/worst month, and positive/negative month counts; optional USD→EUR conversion via Frankfurter API
- Progressive disclosure: methodology section collapsed by default; one-time guide strip for new users; "Avanzato" badge on technical metrics (TWR, IRR, Sharpe, YOC); each chart has an inline 2-line reading hint
- Animated metric cards: values count up on load and settle more naturally during period changes; staggered entrance cascade per section
- Dashboard KPI cards (Total Portfolio, Liquid Net Worth, Unrealized Gains, Taxes) animate their values on page load — numbers count up from zero once on mount; each card animates independently so the rest of the page stays stable during the animation
- All major pages (Dashboard, Hall of Fame, History, Performance, Dividends) animate on load with staggered card entrances and smooth expand/collapse transitions; respects system "Reduce Motion" preference
- All charts animate on load: bars grow up from baseline, lines draw in left to right, area fills expand, pie slices fan out — covers every page with data visualization (History, Performance, Cashflow, Dividends, FIRE, Monte Carlo, Goals)
- AI-powered analysis using Claude with Extended Thinking and web search
- **AI Assistant** with persistent conversation history, automatic memory, and five analysis modes: monthly, annual, YTD, total history, and free chat. Each structured mode provides Claude with a full numeric context panel (net worth delta, cashflow, allocation changes, sub-category breakdown) for the selected period. Chat mode has a context type selector to optionally attach any period's data without forcing the structured format. The assistant remembers goals, preferences, risk profile, and stable facts across conversations — visible and editable in a dedicated Memory panel. Memory goals can now be marked as completed through explicit suggestions when the system detects that a numeric target has been reached from authoritative portfolio data. Full conversation continuity within threads: follow-up messages ("Approfondisci", "Come mai?") are answered with awareness of prior exchanges. Suggested prompt chips, streaming markdown responses (including tables), per-thread period pinning, sticky right panel, and navigable conversation list on desktop and mobile. Web search for macro/geopolitical context with specific event citation. Controlled rollout via feature flag.
- Fully responsive on mobile and tablet: dropdown period selector, stacked header, color-only heatmap view on small screens

### Cashflow
- Income and expense tracking with custom categories and subcategories, entered via a guided two-step dialog: pick the expense type first (Variable, Fixed, Debt/Installment, Income), then fill in only the relevant fields for that type
- **Budget tab**: automatic budget tracking for all expense categories — items auto-generated from your categories with no manual setup; annual view with progress bars comparing current year vs budget, previous year, and historical average; click any row (category, section subtotal, or Total Expenses/Income) to open a historical year×month panel with min/max month highlights; Total Expenses also shows a per-type breakdown (Fixed / Variable / Debt) as separate month-by-month tables; collapsible sections with reordering; fully responsive on mobile with tappable cards and a per-item detail dialog
- Bulk move transactions between categories/subcategories (cross-type supported)
- 5-layer Sankey diagram visualization
- 4-level drill-down for detailed expense analysis with hierarchical back-navigation that returns to the immediate parent view before the full flow
- Period analysis with year and month filters — filtered sections include expense type breakdown (Fixed / Variable / Debt) pie chart that updates with the active filter
- CSV export

### Dividends
- Multi-currency dividend recording with automatic EUR conversion
- Borsa Italiana scraping for Italian market data (dividends and bond prices)
- Monthly calendar view with synchronized date focus and drill-down
- Dividend statistics, contextual payment detail, and yield calculations
- **Total Return per Asset**: table combining unrealized capital gain % and all-time net dividends received % (calculated at historical cost basis per payment, not diluted by later purchases) to show the true investment return per asset; card layout on mobile
- **Dividend Per Share Growth**: year-by-year gross DPS history per equity asset with YoY% and CAGR columns; portfolio median growth rate shown as a summary; tap any asset on mobile to open a vertical year-by-year dialog

### Historical Analysis
- Automatic monthly portfolio snapshots (via Vercel cron)
- Net worth evolution, asset class breakdown, and liquidity charts
- Year-over-Year variation analysis
- Savings vs Investment Growth comparison (annual and monthly views)
- **Labor & Investments section**: lifetime KPI cards for Earned from Work, Saved from Work, Investment Growth Gross/Net, plus counters for positive and negative months based on total monthly net worth growth, and a monthly breakdown chart — visible when labor income categories are configured in Settings
- Doubling time analysis with geometric calculations and fixed thresholds

### FIRE Planning
- FIRE calculator with primary residence exclusion
- Dedicated Coast FIRE tab with saved retirement age, no-new-contributions projections, and Bear / Base / Bull real-return scenarios
- Coast FIRE supports one or more state pensions with editable IRPEF brackets, exact pension start dates, scenario-specific real net conversion, a guided summary that separates target-age need, bridge years, and post-pension steady state, plus a collapsible configuration panel that keeps the active inputs visible
- Multi-scenario projections (Bear / Base / Bull) with inflation adjustment
- Per-scenario FIRE numbers with automatic savings stop at FIRE reached
- Historical FIRE runway view with rolling 12-month expenses, separate total/liquid deltas, and a sensitivity matrix for annual spending vs annual savings
- **Goal-Based Investing**: allocate portfolio portions to financial goals (house, retirement, emergency fund, etc.) with progress tracking, recommended allocation comparison, and open-ended goal support
- **Goal-Driven Allocation**: optionally derive portfolio allocation targets as a weighted average of goal recommended allocations, with automatic fallback to manual targets
- Fully responsive on mobile and tablet — tab navigation uses a dropdown on small screens, year-by-year projection table switches to a card layout

### Monte Carlo Simulations
- 4 asset classes: Equity, Bonds, Real Estate, Commodities
- Editable parameters per asset class (returns, volatility)
- Bear/Base/Bull scenario comparison with overlay charts and distribution analysis
- Auto-fill allocation from real portfolio (crypto and cash excluded, normalized to 100%)
- Fully responsive on mobile and tablet — percentile table switches to a card layout, scenario parameter cards stack vertically

### Other
- **Periodic email summaries with AI commentary** — Automatic portfolio recap emails sent at the end of each month, quarter (March/June/September/December), and year (December 31), each with its own toggle. Emails include net worth change vs the previous period, asset class breakdown with allocation %, best/worst performing asset class (by Δ% and Δ€), income vs expenses with savings rate, full income and expense category breakdowns (all categories, each with EUR total and % of period total), top 5 individual expense transactions, dividends received, and an AI-generated narrative analysis that connects portfolio performance to global macro events (web search always active). Recipients shared across all three email types; manual send buttons in Settings for on-demand previews. Powered by [Resend](https://resend.com) (free tier sufficient for personal use)
- **Public demo mode** — "Try the Demo" button on the login page and landing page auto-logs visitors into a shared read-only account. All mutation actions are disabled; the AI Assistant is fully blocked. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_*` env vars to enable; leave them empty to hide the CTA on self-hosted deploys
- **Color Themes** — Six selectable color themes (Default, Solar Dusk, Elegant Luxury, Midnight Bloom, Cyberpunk, Retro Arcade) with per-user persistence in Firestore and localStorage. Theme selector in Settings → Aspetto with light/dark preview swatches. Switching dark/light mode plays a circle-reveal animation from the toggle. Charts update their palette to match the active theme
- **Dark mode** — Full dark/light/system theme support. The header toggle cycles through three states: Light, Dark, and System (follows OS preference), using Sun, Moon, and Monitor icons. Every page, chart tooltip, and UI component is properly themed
- **Authentication flow** — Login and registration screens follow the same visual language as the dashboard, with accessible focus states, keyboard-friendly password toggles, and clearer in-place submit feedback
- **Hall of Fame** — Monthly and annual performance rankings with current-period spotlight cards, contextual notes, and fully responsive mobile/tablet layouts
- **PDF Export** — 8 configurable sections with custom year/month period selection; sections auto-disabled for past periods when historical data is unavailable
- **Settings** — Unsaved-change feedback, smooth nested allocation editing, and contextual confirmations for sensitive category actions

See [`.env.local.example`](.env.local.example) for detailed comments on each variable.

### Security Notes

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*` values are client configuration, not server secrets. They are expected to be visible in the browser bundle.
- Keep `FIREBASE_ADMIN_*`, `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY`, `CRON_SECRET`, and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` server-only.
- Private App Router API routes are expected to verify Firebase ID tokens server-side. Scheduled cron flows authenticate separately with `CRON_SECRET`.

**Key design patterns:**
- **App Router** with protected dashboard routes
- **Service layer** (`lib/services/`) for all business logic
- **React Query** for client-side data caching and mutations
- **Feature-based component organization** (by domain, not by layer)
- **Timezone-aware** date handling (Europe/Rome)

## Development

### Commands

```bash
npm run dev        # Start dev server with hot-reload
npm run build      # Production build
npm run start      # Start production server
npm run lint       # Run ESLint
npm test           # Run unit tests (single run)
npm run test:watch # Run tests in watch mode
```

### Conventions

- **UI language**: Italian
- **Code language**: English (comments explain WHY, not WHAT — see [COMMENTS.md](COMMENTS.md))
- **Responsive breakpoint**: `desktop:` (1440px) instead of Tailwind's default `lg:`
- **Radix UI imports**: All `components/ui/` primitives import from the `radix-ui` umbrella package with named imports (`{ X as XPrimitive }`) — not from individual `@radix-ui/react-*` packages
- **Radix Select**: No empty string values — use sentinel values like `__all__`
- **Settings changes**: Always update type definition + getter + setter together

## Deployment

### Vercel (recommended)

1. Import the repository on [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Add all environment variables from `.env.local`
3. Deploy — cron jobs for snapshots and dividends are configured in `vercel.json`

Two cron jobs run daily at 18:00 UTC:
- `/api/cron/monthly-snapshot` — Automatic monthly portfolio snapshots
- `/api/cron/daily-dividend-processing` — Dividend data processing

> For detailed instructions, see [VERCEL_SETUP.md](VERCEL_SETUP.md).

### Docker (self-hosted)

Run the app on any VPS or server with Docker. Firebase still handles authentication and the database.

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local  # fill in your Firebase credentials
docker compose up -d --build
```

> For the full guide including cron job setup and nginx/HTTPS configuration, see [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! When contributing:

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch
2. Follow the existing code conventions (Italian UI, English code)
3. Read [COMMENTS.md](COMMENTS.md) for the project's commenting philosophy
4. Ensure `npm run build` passes before submitting a PR

### Reporting Issues

- Use the [bug report template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) for bugs
- Use the [feature request template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md) for new ideas

## Known Issues

- Currency conversion depends on the Frankfurter API (falls back to 24h-cached rates); non-EUR assets created before the FX update will show native price as EUR until the next price refresh
- Demo account requires manual setup: create a Firebase user, populate Firestore with realistic fake data, and set the three `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_*` env vars
